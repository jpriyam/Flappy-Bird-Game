# Flappy-Bird-Game
The game is a side-scroller where the player controls a bird with the spacebar, attempting to fly between columns of green pipes without hitting them. If the spacebar is not tapped, the bird falls because of gravity; each pair of pipes that he navigates between earns the player a single point.Basic Game where you click on the screen, or use your spacebar to get started. Fly the bird as far as you can without hitting any pipe.
